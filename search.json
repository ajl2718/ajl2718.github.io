I have led over 15 data science projects in business, government and academia, with a recent focus on clinical data science.\nMy current projects involve application of machine learning and statistical techniques to linked primary care data for cancer research. This is a complex area in terms of the data and domain knowledge required, and also involves a fair amount of bureaucratic wrangling (definitely the less fun part of the job).\nMy technical expertise ranges from data cleaning and wrangling (Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Arrow), to machine learning model development (Pytorch, Keras), data visualisation (seaborn, ggplot), deployment (Azure) and, recently, fine-tuning LLMs for faciliating data science workflows.\nA large part of my current role and previous role involves communicating and translating between domains, for example working with clinicians to refine ideas so that they can be translated into data science problems. This is challenging but also rewarding and a good source of ideas for data science applications."

I like to keep up-to-state with developments in the field. Outside of work I enjoy riding my bike, languages, cooking, music and reading."

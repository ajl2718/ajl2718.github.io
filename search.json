This is a complex area in terms of the data and domain knowledge required, and also often involves working with many different stakeholders.\nMy technical skill set ranges from data cleaning and analysis (Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Arrow), to machine learning model development (Pytorch, Keras), data visualisation (Seaborn, ggplot), deployment (Azure) and, recently, fine-tuning LLMs for facilitating data science workflows.\nA large part of my current role and previous role involves communicating across domains, for example working with clinicians to refine ideas so that they can be translated into data science problems. This is challenging but also rewarding and a good source of ideas for applications, tools and open problems."

This tool is currently being trialled in general practices and will allow clinicians to better identify higher risk patients, benefiting both clinicians and their patients.\n\n\n\nPart of my work has involved helping to develop linked data infrastructure to support research into cancer services by bringing together data from primary care, hospitals and cancer registries. This has been a big team effort and is now the first such resource in Australia.

This tool was used for COVID-19 reporting, analysis and research throughout the pandemic and saved substantial time in manually reviewing data.\n\n\nAutomated tools for geospatial data collection\nIn my work at Gapmaps I developed a system for automatically extracting and transforming geospatial data on business locations, replacing the exisiting manual approach and saving substantial time and money for the business."
